PROJECT NOTES — Yuri Alberto Analysis
1. Project Context

This project was designed with the objective of applying sports data analysis to a real-world football decision-making scenario, specifically in the context of player evaluation for recruitment purposes.

The chosen player is Yuri Alberto, a Brazilian striker, due to his career path across different clubs and distinct phases, which allows for a consistent analysis of performance evolution and attacking efficiency.

2. Analysis Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to evaluate:

the player’s performance evolution across seasons

his attacking efficiency as a striker

whether his current profile indicates continuous improvement or a possible performance peak

The results aim to simulate the type of analysis commonly used by scouting and performance analysis departments.

3. Key Questions

The following questions guide the entire analysis:

Has the player’s attacking efficiency improved over the seasons as he gained experience?

How many shots are required, on average, for the player to score a goal, and has this relationship improved over time?

Based on performance data, does the player present an attractive profile for recruitment decisions?

These questions were defined before data collection, ensuring a hypothesis-driven analysis rather than purely exploratory work.

4. Required Data (Planning Phase)

To answer the proposed questions, the following data will be required:

seasons

clubs

minutes played

goals

shots

matches played (starter / substitute, if available)

The data will be sourced from reliable public databases and subsequently cleaned and prepared for analysis.

5. Planned Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using:

SQL for queries, aggregations, and metric creation

exploratory data analysis to identify patterns

normalized metrics (e.g., goals per 90 minutes)

Results will be presented through simple visualizations and objective interpretations.

6. Scope and Limitations

This project does not aim to:

evaluate collective tactical impact

analyze team titles or overall team performance

deeply explore injuries or disciplinary records (future phase)

The focus is exclusively on individual attacking efficiency.

7. Next Steps

Identify and select the most appropriate dataset

Perform data cleaning and standardization

Create the first SQL queries

Develop analyses and visualizations
